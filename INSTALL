You can use Project Builder or pbxbuild to build the Hebrew Spelling Service. The HSpellService target includes an Hspell subtarget that makes the necessary parts of Hspell.

To install the service, put the Hebrew Spelling.service file in /Library/Services or ~/Library/Services

You need to log out and re-log in in order to make the service available.

To remove the service, take it out of the Services folder where you installed it. After you log out, the service will no longer be available.
