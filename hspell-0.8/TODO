Really important stuff to be done:
* Extend the list of known verbs, nouns, proper nouns, relation words, etc.
  In this one, the general public could really help.
* We no longer add prefixes without any judgment, and now reject non-words like
  לשמרתי (to guarded) or הלמדנה (the + ladies, learn!). However, we should be
  even smarter and reject wrong prefixes before milot/extrawords as in כשה+מתי
  and refine our judgement in order to reject מכ+בית but accpept מכ+מאה
* Improve quality of correction-suggestion algorithm.
* Include documentation for hspell-i and multispell (if hspell -i is the
  same as hspell, then document hspell-i in the hspell man page and link
  them) and the -i option for hspell.

Quite important things:
* Support the infinitive with different prefixes (not just Lamed) and without
  prefixes ("absolute infinitive"). For example, not only לעבור (to pass) is
  correct, but so is בעוברו (when he passes) and עוברם (their passing). 
  The "fat" version of release 0.5 supports most, but not all, of these.
* Improve the library API to the C-based spell-checker
* Have a better and more complete ispell-like interface to hspell. Version 0.3
  has a rudimentary one.

Good to have:
* Rewrite the whole thing using Uzzi Ornan's transcript internally. This would
  probably induce a simpler, more elegant code, and enable us to add Niqqud
  (Hebrew accentation) to the game sometime in the future.
* Add statistics to each conjugation. לשבותך (for your repatriation) is less 
  probable word than לשבת (to sit), and it might help the user to know that.
* Support other, non-academia, spelling standards. Try to gather some
  statististics on which spellings are more frequently used in practice.

Far fetched:
* Add support for Niqqud.
* Make use of the morphological information about the conjugations. Outputing
  morphological information can help the user understand a corrected word, and
  may facilitate word analysis, automatic translations, understanding,
  intelligent search, and more.
* Use the Niqqud support for text-to-speech application.
